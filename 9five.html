            9Five was winning. They had the ultimate advantage: Product-market
            fit. The Greek market was responding well to the brand’s modern
            designs and lifestyle-first marketing approach. However, the
            challenge was that the store’s growth was largely fueled by the
            Founder, who was strong in media buying. That put a hard limit on
            the brand’s potential to grow.
            <br>
            <br>
            The ads were impossible to scale after a certain volume. Exploring
            new channels like YouTube and Google Ads wasn’t going as smoothly
            as 9Five hoped, and growth was starting to halt. When we started
            working with the brand, we decided we’d focus on tackling two main
            challenges.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="solution each_main_description_block">
          <p class="section_title">The Solution</p>
          <p class="section_description">
            First, we’d make the email marketing channel a big revenue and
            profit contributor. This added cash in the pocket would then allow
            the brand to reinvest more in advertising, scale its social, and
            diversify in new channels more effectively. Secondly, we’d do
            everything in a fully automated way. Not just the core automation
            like cart and checkout abandonment. But also more advanced
            journeys, such as passive user research, review collection, and
            even highly personalized, plain-text “check-up” campaigns (a
            shockingly underutilized technique to enhance the shopper’s
            experience and boost deliverability).
            <br>
            <br>
            A huge buying block for shopping for sunglasses online is the
            inability to know whether they’d fit your face without trying them
            on. Working together with the brand, we developed an on-site
            “quiz-like” experience that allowed the users to select the most
            appropriate glasses based on their facial bone structure and
            gender.
            <br>
            <br>
            It was a campaign that matched the user’s needs perfectly. Even
            though we hacked it together in a couple of hours using nothing
            more than WordPress’s Elementor Pro, the results speak for
            themselves.
            <br>
            <br>
            The campaign topped at a 38% conversion rate and averaged a 20.5%
            conversion rate over a 7-month period, But here’s the best part.
            We used this opportunity to also collect zero-party data from the
            subscribers. In the future, this means we’d be able to make
            personalized recommendations based on the user’s gender and facial
            structure.
            <br>
            <br>
            We created the core e-commerce flows. This included retargeting
            automation, such as cart and browse abandonment flows. It included
            onboarding journeys for new subscribers and post-purchase
            sequences that ensured the shopper’s expectations were met. The
            difference is in how we executed this automation.
            <br>
            <br>
            Online shopping lacks the human touch offered in brick-and-mortar
            stores. Apart from that, when it comes to eyewear specifically,
            each subscriber has different needs and styles. Even though the
            price point is not high, there is anxiety.
            <br>
            <br>
            The way we alleviated that anxiety was through highly personalized
            content. The automation pushed new sales, yes, but they also
            checked how the shopper was doing, whether they were happy with
            their purchase, what new products the brand ought to develop, and
            more.
   
            The Greek e-commerce market is thriving but years behind in
            marketing innovation. This was a highly unusual experience for
            Greek shoppers. They responded in an extremely positive way.
            First, by shopping. In as little as 90 days, email marketing was
            contributing 20% to the store’s total revenue. Secondly, by
            replying to the brand’s emails, giving feedback, reviewing
            products, and actively engaging with the brand’s content in other
            channels.
